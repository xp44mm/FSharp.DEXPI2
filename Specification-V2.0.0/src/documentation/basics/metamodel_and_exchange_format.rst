DEXPI XML Schema
================

`Download DEXPI_XML_Schema_RC_1.xsd <../_static/DEXPI_XML_Schema.xsd>`_.

There is also a `generated XML Schema documentation <../_static/DEXPI_XML_Schema_doc/index.html>`_.

Several DEXPI XML files are provided. See

- :sp:element:`Model Builtin <Builtin>`,

- :sp:element:`Model Core <Core>`,

- :sp:element:`Model Plant <Plant>`,

- :sp:element:`Model Process <Process>`,

- :ref:`DEXPI Reference P&ID <reference-pid>`.

The root element of a DEXPI XML file has the name :code:`Model`. Its complex type is :code:`Model`.


Simple Types
------------

ID
~~

An :code:`ID` is an :code:`xsd:string` with the same restrictions as a :code:`name`. In addition, an :code:`ID` must be unique in a DEXPI XML file.


IDREF
~~~~~

An :code:`IDREF` is a reference to an :code:`ID` in the same file. It starts with a number sign ("hash", :code:`#`) that is immediately followed by the referenced :code:`ID`.


name
~~~~

A :code:`name` is an :code:`xsd:string` that

- starts with an underscore (:code:`_`) or an upper (:code:`A-Z`) or lower case (:code:`a-z`) letter (ASCII only).

- The start character may be followed by an arbitrary number of underscores, upper or lower case letters, or digits (:code:`0-9`) in an arbitrary order.


nameOrIdReference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :code:`nameOrIdReference` is either a :code:`nameReference` or an :code:`IDREF`.


nameOrIdReferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :code:`nameOrIdReferences` contains one or more :code:`nameOrIdReference` parts, separated by a space character.



nameReference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :code:`nameReference` is a reference to a :code:`name` in an arbitrary DEXPI XML file. It is composed of

- a reference to a DEXPI XML file. This is either the :code:`prefix` of an imported file (see complex type :code:`Import`) or the empty string if it refers to the current file (i.e., the file that contains the :code:`nameReference`);

- a slash character (:code:`/`);

- a :code:`name`. This :code:`name` refers to the child element of the XML file's :code:`Model` element with that :code:`name`.

Optionally, the :code:`nameReference` may contain further :code:`name`\s, each separated by a dot (:code:`.`), in order to refer to further, nested elements.

CompositionProperty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A composition property, i.e., a property whose type must be a class and which indicates a composition (as opposed to a simple reference, cf. ReferenceProperty).

Data
~~~~

The values for a data property for an object or aggregated data type.

DataProperty
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A data property, i.e., a property whose type must be a data type.

Attributes:
